# VBA-Challenge-2
Module 2 Challenge

Hello,

Thank you for reviewing my VBA Challenge 2!... and boy was it a challenge!

In this repo you will find a .vbs file labeled Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_Kyle Novak_FinalSheet Code.vbs, a word document, and 3 screen grabs that were required for the assignment.

The .vbs file Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_Kyle Novak_FinalSheet Code.vbs has my final script code for you to view and/or copy and paste to the initial multiple_year_stock_data .xsl sheet found in Module 2.

In the off chance of an error of accessing the .vbs file, I have also included a word document file named Script Code_Module 2_KNovak_Final Code, where you can find my final script code that is on the .vbs file labeled Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_Kyle Novak_FinalSheet Code.vbs.

The screen grabs are for each of the 3 worksheets (2018, 2019, and 2020). Those files are labeled as ScreenGrab_Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_KNovak_2018, ScreenGrab_Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_KNovak_2019, and ScreenGrab_Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_KNovak_2020. They should provide proof that the script code worked and looped through all sheets.

Hope this README.md provides you a detailed guide of where to find all components of my VBA-Challenge-2. Please reach out should you have any issues viewing/accessing the files.


Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
