# VBA-Challenge-2
Module 2 Challenge

Hello,

Thank you for reviewing my VBA Challenge 2!... and boy was it a challenge!
In this repo you will find multiple excel files, .vbs files, a word document, and screen grabs that were required for the assignment.

The word document file named Script Code_Module 2_KNovak_Final Code is where you can find my final code for you to easily copy and paste in file labeled Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx (if you do not happen to have access to the intial blank starter file). Keep in mind that a module has not been created in this particular file, so you would need to create a new module.

Excel .vbs file named Multiple_Year_Stock_Data_Module 2_Kyle Novak_FinalSheet Code.vbs is the exported than imported .vbs file for the Multiple_year_stock_data_Module 2_KNovak_FinalSheet. The Final Sheet is where I took the screen grabs for this assignment.

The files labeled Multiple_year_stock_data_Module 2_KNovak_Run On Every Worsheet , Multiple_year_stock_data_Module 2_KNovak_TickYear_Percent ChangeTotalStockVolume , and Multiple_year_stock_data_Module 2_KNovak_GreatestPercentIncreaseDecrease and Total Volume are files that show my progress of completing the assignment and .vbs files for each have been added on here as well. I chose to break it down into 3 separate files to play it safe if I should have lost my progress along the way.

Screen grab files are named Module 2_VBA_KNOVAK_ScreenGrab 1 and Module 2_VBA_KNOVAK_ScreenGrab 2.

Hope this README.md provides you a detailed guide of where to find all components of my VBA-Challenge-2.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
